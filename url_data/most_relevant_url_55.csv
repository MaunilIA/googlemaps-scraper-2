ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbE8tLU9nEAE,We had recently visited this villa. We booked a super deluxe room for 2 here which was charged at ‚Çπ2500 per day without food. We didn't have an excellent experience here.  1. Firstly hot water time is 7 AM to 10 AM but it usually comes by 8 or later. Basin taps and jets are not in good condition.  2. No working AC. We had changed our room once from 104 to 208 but there too the AC was broken and we were unable to change temperature.  3. Rooms have 'seelan' as shown in pics and the beds are damp. You would feel very cold even with blankets on due to this dampness.  4. Room no 208 had a smelly bedsheet which they changed after a number of complaints.  5. There are power cuts as well. Sometimes for hours. No telecom was there in 208. When asked they gave a mobile number and asked to call that number if needed.  Overall the property is good but not well maintained. Don't go by the online pictures on MakeMyTrip and other websites. Reception staff will remind you of pending payment if any and if you complain of non working AC or dirty room they will just say 'kisi ko bhejta hu'.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMllfbWxRRRAB,My experience in the stay with family was as follows and I am mentioning some points for improvement as under:  Good points:  Staff Very accomodative and good Overall approach satisfactory  Improvement:  Food to be served properly not to restrict as it's a buffet. Staff to view the no of passengers and keep the daily usables like towels Slippers should be there in every room Maintenance activity needs to be done in overall resort Playground for kids need to be developed Dinner lunch and breakfast need to be kid friendly and less spicy  Overall a thumbs up to the staff and management a big 4 star for the resort, a year ago on   Google  ,2023-02-14 18:08:18.959196,4.0,kishore hingwani,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113462795791500120725/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOV82QUh3EAE,"Detailed Review: TLDR AVAILABLE AT LAST  LOCATION: Located close to Satara Highway, Bus stand and Local shops are close by. Pretty much at the Center of the City. The Hotel was made at a spot of forest, so expect a lot of trees everywhere in premise and good thing they didn't cut trees for making the buildings.  ROOM: The room was good, however you can't open the windows if you are in 10X series of rooms, so no good view also you won't have any privacy if you want to keep the window open since the passage is right front of it.  SERVICE: Room service was average to bad, the Intercom didn't work, asked 4 times to change and yet it wasn't changed. Water bottles worth Rs. 15/- were charged for Rs. 30/- AND THEY DON'T EVEN PROVIDE BILL FOR IT! I asked for bill at least 12-15 times before I left.  MEALS: All meals are available in either Pure Veg and Jain style. The Menu is good for all meals so no need to worry about it.  Overall/TLDR: Pros: 1. Well maintained Greenery and Flower beds 2. Swimming pool with Jacuzzi for kids 3. Good and unlimited food for all the meals 4. Service boy can get your Breakfast / Snacks on request (but there's a con about it)  Cons: 1. Rooms feel suffocating if you are in 10X series of rooms here. 2. Room service is useless if you don't have a working Intercom. Service desk help is pretty much useless. 3. Water bottles are sold at higher price than MRP which is illegal. 15rs. Bottles are sold as high 20 and 30 rs. ASK FOR BILL! if they provide, you can sue them in the court of law. 4. The service staff brings breakfast /snacks to your room but you need to go tell them physically (since you don't have Intercom working).", 8 months ago on   Google  ,2023-02-14 18:08:18.991602,2.0,Tejas rawal,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118194720839165239017/reviews?hl=en-US

Hot water supply starts from 0630 hrs to 1030 hrs. If someone wants to have a bath after a day's outing in this tourist place he has to use cold water only. This is the first hotel I've seen with limited hot water timings. Swimming pool opens at 1000 hrs and closes at 1700 hrs. Now Mahabaleshwar is a tourist spot so the guests will be out the whole day and when they will come back they will find the pool closed. So why are we paying for the pool? The food is another negative point. All meals are buffet with very limited variety. Breakfast is good though but lunch and dinner is very bad. All the dishes are so spicy that one can not eat properly.

The pictures on the Internet are flattering but not realistic. Let me talk of the pro's first. We were 2 adults and 2 kids, but we were alloted a cottage space with two huge rooms and super huge beds. It is located within walking distance from the market and also has basic stores within walking distance. Ample of parking and well maintained outside lawn area. Warm and supportive staff. Average quality but a variety of food (only vegetarian). Free Wi-Fi net facility was provided. Now let's look at the downside. The rooms that we were allotted was completely isolated from any outside view. It felt like a jail. Because of the rainy season, the complete cottage was covered with the blue tarpaulin and it felt like living on a construction site. Bathtub provided, but extremely dirty and we did not feel like using it. The toilets are also very dirty. Room cleanliness is about average. No toiletry provided. No hand faucet, no tissue papers. Swimming pool functions from 9.30 am - 5.30pm which is the general time of touring outside. Check out time is 8 a.m. & by 8:15 you will start receiving warnings.

Pros:  1. Huge property with lots of trees and plants 2. Villas and Some Rooms are decent [Be careful go and see before you take the keys] Some rooms are very small and some are bigger 3. Awesome Food and Great Dining Area [Food Quality was the best So Do Opt for it] 4. Main Market just a hop skip hop and near ST Stand 5.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnMi1XSklREAE,"I had been to Shanti Villa almost 2 times after my wedding. I must say, their service is nice... from your starting point of boarding bus from Mumbai till you leave the hotel and you reach back to Mumbai... Their housekeeping staff are local people... humble request to guests! please don't expect 5 star treatment! They are very well mannered though if you have guts to speak politely and request them instead of just ordering like you are the owner!  I must say, they serve the best available food.. and you wont believe, you would just love having it when you compare the rush in the restaurants out side and also the quality of food. They serve all the meals, Breakfast, Lunch, evening snacks with coffee and tea and dinner. Also one free trip for sightseeing from them is also fair enough!  They have swimming pool and few rides exactly at the middle of the resort, which is good enough for summer time small noon enjoyment and having a feel of water park rather having nothing, compared to few hotels in Mahabaleshwar!  I have a bit of advise for them, please do some renovations in the rooms at the right side of the resort the moment you enter to the resort. Those are appearing very old rooms and they really need improvement! Otherwise electricity issues, geyser not working or hot water issue or TV not functioning are very common issues wherever you go through out the world and it can come up any time any where! BUT still that is a trigger for management to think seriously on it!  Over all i can say Shanti Villa is very well but economical hotel in Mahabaleshwar! one should really think of it if have a plan to visit there!
