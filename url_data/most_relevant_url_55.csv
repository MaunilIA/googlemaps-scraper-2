ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbE8tLU9nEAE,We had recently visited this villa. We booked a super deluxe room for 2 here which was charged at ‚Çπ2500 per day without food. We didn't have an excellent experience here.  1. Firstly hot water time is 7 AM to 10 AM but it usually comes by 8 or later. Basin taps and jets are not in good condition.  2. No working AC. We had changed our room once from 104 to 208 but there too the AC was broken and we were unable to change temperature.  3. Rooms have 'seelan' as shown in pics and the beds are damp. You would feel very cold even with blankets on due to this dampness.  4. Room no 208 had a smelly bedsheet which they changed after a number of complaints.  5. There are power cuts as well. Sometimes for hours. No telecom was there in 208. When asked they gave a mobile number and asked to call that number if needed.  Overall the property is good but not well maintained. Don't go by the online pictures on MakeMyTrip and other websites. Reception staff will remind you of pending payment if any and if you complain of non working AC or dirty room they will just say 'kisi ko bhejta hu'.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMllfbWxRRRAB,My experience in the stay with family was as follows and I am mentioning some points for improvement as under:  Good points:  Staff Very accomodative and good Overall approach satisfactory  Improvement:  Food to be served properly not to restrict as it's a buffet. Staff to view the no of passengers and keep the daily usables like towels Slippers should be there in every room Maintenance activity needs to be done in overall resort Playground for kids need to be developed Dinner lunch and breakfast need to be kid friendly and less spicy  Overall a thumbs up to the staff and management a big 4 star for the resort, a year ago on   Google  ,2023-02-14 20:10:20.845315,4.0,kishore hingwani,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113462795791500120725/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOV82QUh3EAE,"Detailed Review: TLDR AVAILABLE AT LAST  LOCATION: Located close to Satara Highway, Bus stand and Local shops are close by. Pretty much at the Center of the City. The Hotel was made at a spot of forest, so expect a lot of trees everywhere in premise and good thing they didn't cut trees for making the buildings.  ROOM: The room was good, however you can't open the windows if you are in 10X series of rooms, so no good view also you won't have any privacy if you want to keep the window open since the passage is right front of it.  SERVICE: Room service was average to bad, the Intercom didn't work, asked 4 times to change and yet it wasn't changed. Water bottles worth Rs. 15/- were charged for Rs. 30/- AND THEY DON'T EVEN PROVIDE BILL FOR IT! I asked for bill at least 12-15 times before I left.  MEALS: All meals are available in either Pure Veg and Jain style. The Menu is good for all meals so no need to worry about it.  Overall/TLDR: Pros: 1. Well maintained Greenery and Flower beds 2. Swimming pool with Jacuzzi for kids 3. Good and unlimited food for all the meals 4. Service boy can get your Breakfast / Snacks on request (but there's a con about it)  Cons: 1. Rooms feel suffocating if you are in 10X series of rooms here. 2. Room service is useless if you don't have a working Intercom. Service desk help is pretty much useless. 3. Water bottles are sold at higher price than MRP which is illegal. 15rs. Bottles are sold as high 20 and 30 rs. ASK FOR BILL! if they provide, you can sue them in the court of law. 4. The service staff brings breakfast /snacks to your room but you need to go tell them physically (since you don't have Intercom working).", 8 months ago on   Google  ,2023-02-14 20:10:20.862025,2.0,Tejas rawal,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118194720839165239017/reviews?hl=en-US
