ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNUkyeTZRRRAB,"(Translated by Google) The museum is an impressive merchandising warehouse, which tells you from the beginning what is going to happen: they take a photograph of you that you know they will sell you at the end for a crazy price. After a couple of waiting rooms and a 15-minute commercial, they leave you free to visit and revisit different rooms, among which are: 1) A vault that supposedly contains the secret formula, but which leads to taking a photo with a locked vault. 2) A fictitious bottling plant that leads to nothing. 3) A room that misses the influence of Coca-Cola in pop culture. 4) A screening room for a 3D movie that is only in 2D and is actually an extended commercial. 5) The finishing touch is a store where, not happy with the high price of admission, they fill you with advertising at a high price. If you want Coca-Cola merch or a souvenir, it's better to go straight to the store.  The two high points are the testing room, where you can try different flavors of drinks produced in different parts of the world, and the attention of a large part of the staff who, in general, are friendly and attentive.  If you are an unconditional lover of Coca-Cola, you will not suffer, but you will not be entertained either. If you want an entertaining museum with interesting content, it is not recommended.  (Original) El museo es un dep√≥sito de merchandising impresionante, que desde el principio te avisa lo que va a suceder: te sacan una fotograf√≠a que sabes que te vender√°n al final a un precio disparatado. Luego de un par de salas de espera y un comercial de 15 minutos, te dejan en libertad de visitar y revisitar distintas salas entre las que se encuentran: 1) Una b√≥veda que, supuestamente, contiene la f√≥rmula secreta, pero que desemboca en sacarse una foto con una b√≥veda cerrada. 2) Una planta embotelladora ficticia que no lleva a nada. 3) Una sala que desaprovecha la influencia de Coca-Cola en la cultura pop. 4) Una sala de proyecci√≥n de una pel√≠cula 3D que s√≥lo est√° en 2D y, en realidad, es un aviso publicitario extendido. 5) el broche de oro es una tienda en donde, no contentos con el alto precio de la entrada, te llenan de publicidad a un alto precio. Si quieres merch de Coca-Cola o alg√∫n recuerdo, mejor pasar directo a la tienda.  Los dos puntos altos son la sala de testeo, en donde puedes probar distintos sabores de bebidas producidas en distintas partes del mundo, y la atenci√≥n de gran parte del staff que, en general, es amable y atento.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCejRUSTFBRRAB,"It was nice to visit this spot of Atlanta. However, I expected more from this place and felt a bit disappointed. I think the historic part, the taste room, and the gift shop are good, but some processes make the visit a little awkward. When I passed the entrance, there was a lounge room with a clock showing the wait time for the next group to enter the museum. Waited about 15 minutes. During the wait time, an employee makes quizzes to try entertaining the visitors. Once we enter the museum, there is another wait room where another employee also tries entertaining people during 15 minutes by talking and showing some historic objects. Next, a movie theater room is open and exhibits a 15-minute ad movie. Only after these you are free to visit the museum. The 3-D movie room was actually in 2-D, and it was another boring ad movie. In summary, It was nice to be there, since I am from another State and country, but the experience could be more pleasant by providing more freedom and fun activities to the visitors. I have been to the humble town of Waco-TX at a competitor brand's museum and my experience was memorable.
