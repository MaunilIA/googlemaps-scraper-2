ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbE8tLU9nEAE,We had recently visited this villa. We booked a super deluxe room for 2 here which was charged at ₹2500 per day without food. We didn't have an excellent experience here.  1. Firstly hot water time is 7 AM to 10 AM but it usually comes by 8 or later. Basin taps and jets are not in good condition.  2. No working AC. We had changed our room once from 104 to 208 but there too the AC was broken and we were unable to change temperature.  3. Rooms have 'seelan' as shown in pics and the beds are damp. You would feel very cold even with blankets on due to this dampness.  4. Room no 208 had a smelly bedsheet which they changed after a number of complaints.  5. There are power cuts as well. Sometimes for hours. No telecom was there in 208. When asked they gave a mobile number and asked to call that number if needed.  Overall the property is good but not well maintained. Don't go by the online pictures on MakeMyTrip and other websites. Reception staff will remind you of pending payment if any and if you complain of non working AC or dirty room they will just say 'kisi ko bhejta hu'.

Tour package planning is very poor👎👎, not all places are covered. You have to pay more money for each extra points to visit. Only half day tour is included in the package and sometimes due to traffic problems you miss your pre planned places to visit. Swimming pool is not so clear and closed for most of the time.  Located at the most suitable place near to market and bus stand", 2 months ago on   Google  ,2023-02-14 17:03:30.261685,3.0,FOODIE ADVENTURER,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107426342240094063561/reviews?hl=en-US
