ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHZ3JyZFFnEAE,"I felt this is a marriage garden and not a hotel. Staff is not professionally trained the way you will find generally in hotel industry. so if you are used to staying in hotels and expecting some level of service, forget it. Few experiences from my stay during weekend 20th-Nov-2021. 1. If you don't have an option and had to choose this hotel, ensure that you have room rates agreed in writing with all details. Don't believe phone conversation. Once you land there they will give some reasons(if you miss getting in writing) and charge you heavy(may be double as well) 2. They have very old ACs, pale yellow colour. ACs will make noise as if water cooler. If you are lucky it will cool also. 3. Even if you have to stay in absence of choice, DO NOT eat here. Very pathetic room service. We waited for 50 minutes for tea and one room got tea (out of 3 rooms we booked), if you see the tea cattle, it looked like not washed for few months. Our member who drank that tea vomited after some time. 4. Some rooms are of good size but they will confuse you with type of rooms so see the rooms and check for yourself before confirming on rates. 5. Bathroom showers are not cleaned for ages so its scaled & jam. You need to use bucket only. Property will look good in pictures and i think people get deceived because of that.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3eDZ2ZmZ3EAE,This place is pure vegetarian !! It seems to be a Jain hotel  Hotel is decent but facilities are not up to the mark (might be coz of location )  No WiFi and lift was not working  Few rooms had no water and TV is not all working !!!!  Room size is ok but outdated furniture (can’t expect as well )  Over all “Ok” types and manageable, 4 years ago on   Google  ,2023-02-14 20:08:59.494075,3.0,Prasshant Sowmithry,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103844228459459385714/reviews?hl=en-US
