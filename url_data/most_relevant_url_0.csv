ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNHNTc0hREAE,"Excellent experience. Magnificent structures and views all around. Locals are really not helpful and give all false information. There are a total of 34 caves among which I felt Cave 16 which is the centre one as soon as we enter and Cave 29 which is a bit far are excellent. For cave 16, If you are fit enough try to climb the hill for the top view. En route to Cave 29, you will get a waterfall and the view is really amazing. Even though this is inside, Cave 29 is huge make sure you don't miss it. It's a holiday on Tuesday(check once before you leave). It will take around 3-4 hours depending on the time you use to take pics. Overall a nice experience. Note: You won't get food inside only water so make sure you get something to eat.

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMXV3TxAB,"E for Ellora, based on my travelphabet, which  is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Aurangabad, MH. Ellora and Ajanta are the landmark of Aurangabad. This is within the main city, half of day is required to see fully and if u are like me to see minutes and details will take 1 day.  Now maintained by ASI. Ellora is one of the largest rock-cut Hindu temple cave complexes in the world, with artwork dating from the period 600‚Äì1000 CE.  Cave 16 features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world, the Kailash temple, a chariot-shaped monument dedicated to the god Shiva. The Kailash temple excavation also features sculptures depicting various Hindu deities as well as relief panels summarizing the two major Hindu epics.  There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to public. These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13‚Äì29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1‚Äì12) and 5 Jain (caves 30‚Äì34) caves, each group representing deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as monasteries of each respective religion. They were built close to one another and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient India. All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Rashtrakuta dynasty, which constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist caves, and the Yadava dynasty, which constructed a number of the Jain caves. Funding for the construction of the monuments was provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region.  Although the caves served as temples and a rest stop for pilgrims, the site's location on an ancient South Asian trade route also made it an important commercial centre in the Deccan region. It is 29 kilometres (18 miles) north-west of Aurangabad, and about 300 kilometres (190 miles) east-northeast of Mumbai. Today, the Ellora Caves, along with the nearby Ajanta Caves, are a major tourist attraction in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).  Derivation of name: Ellora, also called Verul or Elura, is the short form of the ancient name Elloorpuram. The older form of the name has been found in ancient references such as the Baroda inscription of 812 CE which mentions ""the greatness of this edifice"" and that ""this great edifice was built on a hill by Krishnaraja at Elapura, the edifice in the inscription being the Kailasa temple. In the Indian tradition, each cave is named and has a suffix Guha (Sanskrit), Lena or Leni (Marathi), meaning cave.  Chronology : The construction at Ellora has been studied since British colonial rule. However, the overlapping styles between the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain caves has made it difficult to establish agreement concerning the chronology of their construction. The disputes generally concern: one, whether the Buddhist or Hindu caves were carved first and, two, the relative dating of caves within a particular tradition. The broad consensus that has emerged is based on comparing the carving styles at Ellora to other cave temples in the Deccan region that have been dated, textual records of various dynasties, and epigraphical evidence found at various archaeological sites near Ellora and elsewhere in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Geri Hockfield Malandra and other scholars[who?] have stated that the Ellora caves had three important building periods: an early Hindu period (~550 to 600 CE), a Buddhist phase (~600 to 730 CE) and a later Hindu and Jain phase (~730 to 950 CE).  The earliest caves may have been built during the Traikutakas and Vakataka dynasties, the latter being known for sponsoring the Ajanta caves. However, it is considered likely that some of the earliest caves, such as Cave 29 (Hindu), were built by the Shiva-inspired Kalachuri dynasty, while the Buddhist caves were built by the Chalukya dynasty.",9 months ago,2023-02-14 20:04:48.471639,5.0,Mahuya Acharya,0,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109906624658050779935/reviews?hl=en-US
