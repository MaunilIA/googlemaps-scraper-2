There was a scent room where we could smell the scents of sweets, spices and fruits. Many coca cola artifacts were displayed very aesthetically throughout the place.  The best was the unlimited tasting of different coca cola products. I think there were around 100 flavours around the world but unfortunately it was too much for me to taste on the same day.

Plenty of cool stuff to see.  Vintage ad signs, vending machines, signs, and so much more.  Take your time and read the walls in each exhibit, the history is really interesting.  The scent room was interesting.  The tasting room was fun.  Trying all the different Coca Cola products from around the world was very cool.  They even had Mezzo Mix, which I used to drink all the time when I lived in Germany.  The gift shop was amazing, so many cool things to buy.

There is some interactivity sprinkled in, but the most interactivity is in the aroma room and the fountain room. I also suggest to bring some tums with you.

There are lots of flavors from different countries and at corner but just has current coke products. If you’ve been to EPCOT in Disney World, you’ll see many familiar products.  Gift shop is cute as always, but to justify spending $21 to drink some weird cokes and then to spend more money in the bookstore is kinda hard, especially since you have to listen to actors and a presentation for the first 20 minutes (can’t skip).

Gift shop was really cute too but of course pricey. It's nice if you combine your visit with aquarium and just park in the georgia aquarium garage. Also the Olympic park and the college football hall of fame (we didn't go). If you want. Stop by the yard milkshake bar. Not far of a walk while you're parked there.

This room had many of the different beverages that Coca Cola make from all over the world. Another interesting part of the museum was the history room.
